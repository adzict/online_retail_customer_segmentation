## Project Description
<a name="Project_Description"></a>

The success of any business depends on its ability to understand its customers and cater to their needs. With the rise of e-commerce and online shopping, it has become increasingly important for businesses to have a deep understanding of their customer base. One way to gain insights into customer behavior is through the use of clustering techniques. In this project, I aim to identify customer segments based on their purchase behavior using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering. I will also heavily focus on Feature Engineering as providing more features will yield better results.

### Data Sources
<a name="Data_Sources"></a>

This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

**Attribute Information:**

- **InvoiceNo**: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.
- **StockCode**: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
- **Description**: Product (item) name. Nominal.
- **Quantity**: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.
- **InvoiceDate**: Invoice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.
- **UnitPrice**: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.
- **CustomerID**: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
- **Country**: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.
